  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a passionate and self-motivated Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end web technologies. I specialize in building dynamic, scalable, and user-friendly web applications using Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, HTML, and CSS. With a keen interest in backend logic and a creative eye for clean UI, I enjoy turning ideas into functional products.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over time, I’ve worked on hands-on projects such as a Car Rental Management System and a Loan Management Application — gaining real-world experience in full-stack development. I'm comfortable working with RESTful APIs, database integration, and MVC frameworks like Spring MVC and JSP/Servlets.
  </p>
  <p>
    I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and continuously improving my skills. Currently, I’m focused on sharpening my Spring Boot and API development expertise while exploring deployment tools like GitHub Pages. My goal is to contribute to impactful software projects and grow as a backend or full stack developer in a forward-thinking company.
